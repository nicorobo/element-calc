_This is an elderly project, one of the first things I made while teaching myself Javascript in college. I recently converted it to Vite so I could get it running again without playing with all the old Gulp plugins, but I've left the sweet, naive essence of the code intact ❤️_

# element-calc

element-calc is a molecular mass calculator in the form of a responsive periodic table.
It uses the [Mendeleev](https://github.com/nickroberts404/Mendeleev) package to access element data, parse user input into compounds, and perform operations on compounds.

Data from Mendeleev comes from the [IUPAC](http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AtWt/)
